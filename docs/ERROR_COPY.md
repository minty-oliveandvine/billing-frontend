# Error copy

How a failure becomes something a user can read. The copy standard is shared
across Minty, minty-payment-request-api, minty-payment-request-web and minty-onboarding-web; the canonical
write-up lives in the Minty repo as `docs/features/ERROR_MESSAGE_LEAKS.md`.

## The standard

> `I couldn't <do the specific thing>. <Short next step>?`

1. Under two sentences.
2. First person -- not `Error:`, not `Failed to`.
3. Name the specific thing: *"that invoice"*, not *"the operation"*.
4. Warm close, no blame. Drop the apology when retrying won't help (a validation
   error, a hard limit) and state the requirement instead:
   `Files need to be under 10MB.`
5. No codes, stack text or HTTP statuses in the visible string. That goes to the log.
6. Sentence case, no `Error:` prefix, no exclamation marks on failures.

House fallback for unknown causes:
`Something went wrong on my end. Mind trying again?`

## The mechanism

Two clients, both normalising:

| File | Talks to | Error type |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/api.ts` | the Django billing backend (`API_BASE/api/v1`) | `ApiError` |
| `components/ui/sidebarHost.ts` (`mintyFetch`, `billingApiFetch`) | Flask's `/api/me/profile` and minty-subscription-api's `/api/me/subscriptions` - the sidebar's reads | `ApiError` (the backend's `error` sentence, else `HOUSE_FALLBACK`) |

`lib/subscriptionNotice.ts` (Flask's subscription notice) is deliberately silent: a failed
notice shows nothing and never throws. This app's own payer-portal client (`lib/payerPortal.ts`,
`PortalError`) was deleted with the portal pages on 2026-10-01.

`resolveApiErrorMessage` decides what a user sees. It shows the server's own
`detail` only when that text survives two guards:

- **`normalizeApiErrorDetail`** flattens what the server sent into a string.
  django-ninja answers a schema failure with `detail: [{type, loc, msg}, ...]`;
  stringifying that put `{"type":"missing","loc":["body","email"]}` in front of
  payers. Pydantic entries are reduced to their `msg`, field-error maps to their
  values, and anything still object-shaped is dropped rather than rendered as
  `[object Object]`.
- **`readsAsProse`** rejects text that is machinery rather than a sentence:
  markup, braces, stack text, or a bare machine code like `invalid_state`.

Anything refused falls back to `STATUS_FALLBACK_MESSAGES` for the status.

### `ApiError.detail` vs `ApiError.message`

`message` is the scrubbed copy a user reads. **`detail` is the server's raw
text**, kept because `isXeroAuthError` and `isDuplicateBillReferenceError` match
on shapes -- Xero rejection payloads, specifically -- that `message` is now
scrubbed of. Match on `detail`, render `message`.

## When you add a `fetch()`

Go through `apiFetch` (or the sidebar host's `mintyFetch` / `billingApiFetch`). If you must catch directly,
narrow to `ApiError`:

```ts
// Wrong: apiFetch does not wrap network failures, so a dropped connection is a
// raw TypeError and the user reads "Failed to fetch".
err instanceof Error ? err.message : "I couldn't load that. Mind trying again?"

// Right:
err instanceof ApiError ? err.message : "I couldn't load that. Mind trying again?"
```

## Deliberate exceptions

None left here. The one there was - the card dialog showing Stripe.js `error.message`
verbatim, the issuer's decline text being the only account of what happened - left with the
payer portal for minty-web on 2026-10-01.
